# Contributing to the Zelda Ocarina of Time Community Retexture Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This project exists to faithfully retexture The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time while preserving its original aesthetic and spirit.  
Whether you’re a pixel artist, UI designer, or emulator enthusiast—your help is welcome.

## 🧭 Getting Started

- **Read the [README](README.md):** It contains the philosophy and expectations of the project.
- **Check the Style Guide:** Ensure your textures match the tone and direction of the project.
- **Coordinate Your Work:** To avoid duplication, post in our issue tracker or Discord (if active) when starting a new area.

## 🧩 Submitting Work

- Submit textures as **PNG** files unless another format is specifically requested.
- Match original filenames and dimensions where possible (use the originals as reference).
- Organize files into folders that reflect the game’s structure (e.g., `kokiri_forest`, `hyrule_field`, `temple_of_time`).
- Include before and after previews when opening a pull request.

## 🎨 Artistic Guidelines

- **Do** aim to cleanly upscale the original look, sharpening fidelity.
- **Do not** stylize drastically unless you have good reason (and it preserves the original feel).
- Use discretion when recreating unreadable or missing assets—maintain context.
- Keep it consistent with surrounding textures.

For examples of approved textures, see the `/textures` directory or previously merged PRs.

## ✅ Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Place your texture files in the correct folder path.
3. Add a short note to the PR explaining the changes.
4. Tag your textures clearly (e.g., “Link’s House static BG”, “Gerudo Valley stone wall”).

We’ll review submissions regularly. Suggestions and tweaks may be requested before merging.
