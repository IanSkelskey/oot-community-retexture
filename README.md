## 🎨 Project Goals

The Ocarina of Time Community Retexture Project is a long-running effort to faithfully upscale and refine the textures of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  
Our mission:

- Preserve the original feel, atmosphere, and identity of the game
- Replace low-res textures (often 32x32) with high-resolution equivalents
- Enhance visual fidelity without introducing stylistic dissonance
- Use creative interpretation sparingly—only when the original is ambiguous or unreadable

Textures submitted should strive to reflect what the original developers may have created if not limited by the hardware of the time.

**🎯 This project is not a reimagining—it's a restoration and refinement.**

## 🗺️ Progress Overview

This pack includes a wide range of completed and in-progress retextures.  
See the full progress list [here](PROGRESS.md).

Some highlights:

- Kokiri Forest ✅
- Hyrule Field ✅
- Dungeon Textures (Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Ice Cavern) ✅
- Market Areas, Shops, Interiors, Grottos ⏳

We welcome help to finish the remaining areas!

## 📐 Style Guide

- Stay on-style: Don't deviate dramatically from the N64 aesthetic
- Refine, don’t reinvent: Clean up, upscale, or add subtle detail
- Creative interpretation: Only if the original material is illegible
- Resolution: Use consistent resolutions that balance quality with emulator performance

## 📜 Terms of Submission

- Your contributions may be replaced by higher-quality submissions over time

## 💾 Emulator Notes

Due to the pack’s size (~900MB), we recommend using NTCore’s 4GB patch on 32-bit emulators to reduce crash risk.  
Not all emulators support large texture packs efficiently.
